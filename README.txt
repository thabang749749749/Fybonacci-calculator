# About Fybonacci

Fybonacci calculator does not constitute retracemental chart.
It is a command-line application that does a simple fibonacci arithmetic.
All that you need to have is a fybonacci.py file and python language to execute the program.
Fybonacci calculator still needs some adjustments to it because it can't calculate negative numbers.
